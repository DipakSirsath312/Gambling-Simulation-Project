# 🎲 Gambling Simulation Project (Java)

This project simulates a gambling scenario in Java where a player places bets, wins or loses based on random chance, and the stakes and outcomes are tracked over time. It’s a fun way to demonstrate programming logic, randomness, loops, and scenario simulation — perfect for practice in object-oriented design.

 ---

 # 🚀 Key Features

Simulates a player placing a bet and randomly winning or losing.

Tracks the amount wagered, outcome of each round, and player’s net change.

Configurable bet amounts and number of rounds.

Uses OOP (classes, objects, methods) to structure the logic.

Demonstrates use of randomization (java.util.Random), loops, conditionals and encapsulation.

🔍 Example Output

Welcome to the Gambling Simulation!

Player starts with $1000

Round 1: Bet $50 — Result: Win! New Balance: $1050

Round 2: Bet $50 — Result: Lose. New Balance: $1000
...
Simulation complete: Total Rounds: 20, Final Balance: $1120

# 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

1. Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, methods)

2. Use of random number generation for simulation

3. Loops to iterate rounds of play

4. Conditionals to determine win/loss and update state

5. Encapsulation and clean method decomposition for readability and maintainability

# 🏁 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/DipakSirsath312/Gambling-Simulation-Project.git

3. Navigate into the project folder:

   cd Gambling-Simulation-Project

4. Compile the Java files (assuming src folder structure):

   javac -d . src/*.java

6. Run the main program:

   java Main

# 📘 Learning Goals

By working through or reviewing this project you will learn how to:

Design a simulation with configurable parameters.

Use randomization and iteration to model real-world phenomena (gambling outcomes).

Structure code cleanly into classes and methods.

Track state and update based on conditions.

Write code that is modular and maintainable.
