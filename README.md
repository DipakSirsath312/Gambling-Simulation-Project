# 🎲 Gambling Simulation Project (Java)

This project simulates a gambling scenario in Java where a player places bets, wins or loses based on random chance, and the stakes and outcomes are tracked over time. It’s a fun way to demonstrate programming logic, randomness, loops, and scenario simulation — perfect for practice in object-oriented design.

 # 🚀 Key Features

Simulates a player placing a bet and randomly winning or losing.

Tracks the amount wagered, outcome of each round, and player’s net change.

Configurable bet amounts and number of rounds.

Uses OOP (classes, objects, methods) to structure the logic.

Demonstrates use of randomization (java.util.Random), loops, conditionals and encapsulation.

🔍 Example Output

Welcome to the Gambling Simulation!

Player starts with $1000

Round 1: Bet $50 — Result: Win! New Balance: $1050

Round 2: Bet $50 — Result: Lose. New Balance: $1000
...
Simulation complete: Total Rounds: 20, Final Balance: $1120

# 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

1. Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, methods)

2. Use of random number generation for simulation

3. Loops to iterate rounds of play

4. Conditionals to determine win/loss and update state

5. Encapsulation and clean method decomposition for readability and maintainability
