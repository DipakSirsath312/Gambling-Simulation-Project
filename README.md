# 🎲 Gambling Simulation Project (Java)

This project simulates a gambling scenario in Java where a player places bets, wins or loses based on random chance, and the stakes and outcomes are tracked over time. It’s a fun way to demonstrate programming logic, randomness, loops, and scenario simulation — perfect for practice in object-oriented design.
